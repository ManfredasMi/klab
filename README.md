In order to run the tests you have to:
1. Git clone/download repo
2. From console: cd into the downloaded repo/folder
3. Run: npm i
4. Run: webdriver-manager start in the same console
5. Open another console/terminal tab/window and run: npm run test
6. In order to run api test type in console: npm run testApi
7. Results are show in the console. Haven't implemented any reporting tool in order to save time

P.S: I've done it on mac. Not sure how it would work on win machine.

Task:
1. Register flow with validation check (using external file for test data)
2. Dresses -> Summer dress table content check and filter tests
